  %h2 About
  %p 
    I spent several years doing the rounds in various London agencies as a web standards and accessibility specialist, working for clients including Virgin, the BBC, PriceWaterhouse Coopers and Red Bull. In pursuit of a broader interest in how and why people use the web I settled into User Experience, helping to conceive and implement effective and usable interfaces for web applications. I am now Head of User Experience for Trampoline Systems.
